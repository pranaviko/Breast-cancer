About the Project
Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment. This project aims to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to this critical task. By analyzing diagnostic data, the models can identify patterns that help distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous cells with high accuracy. This can potentially assist healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions.

Dataset
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. This dataset includes 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe the characteristics of cell nuclei, which are used as inputs for the predictive models. The output is a binary classification: Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous).

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing the raw data for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand the relationships between different features and their correlation with the diagnosis.

Model Training: Implementation and training of various classification models to find the one with the best performance.

Performance Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Machine Learning Models
The following models are explored and implemented in this project:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Usage
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/pranaviko/Breast-cancer.git](https://github.com/pranaviko/Breast-cancer.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Breast-cancer

Install the required Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib). You can create a virtual environment first:

pip install -r requirements.txt # (if a requirements file is available)

Or, install them manually:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

jupyter notebook
